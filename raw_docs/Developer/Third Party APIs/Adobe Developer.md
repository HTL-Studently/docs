# Adobe Developer Console

## Why we are currently not using it

It is not possible to host a Adobe environment to test the Adobe Developer Console without registering and paying for the environment. Using the schools environment would require using actuall administrator users and permissions and would allow the manipulation of actuall license data.

## Why we need it

Using the Adobe Developer API Adobe users and licenses can be viewed and managed. 

## Adobe Admin Console

The Adobe Admin Console is used to generate and manage Projects and its own API Keys. It is not as accessible and easy to use as the Microsoft Graph API. An administrate access to the Console is needed for further steps.
