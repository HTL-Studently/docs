## Concept

This project aims to build an application that integrates a finance management system for the in-school finances. The project members are students of the HTL Villach, and the application should be implemented to work in their school. The application should enable HTL Villach students and teachers alike to manage the finances and payments within the school. The application should include an UI where students can view upcoming and completed payments, as well as view and request licenses. The class teacher can create payment requests for the class and request licenses to their students individually or for the entire class. For higher authorities in the school, they should also be able to access the management tab, which allows for the creation of email-lists and the activation and deactivation of accounts. It also informs the school authorities of incoming payments and displays the payments of the school sorted by department and classes. Authentication, authorization and other security mechanisms should be implemented by user validation via Microsoft email.


## Motivation

Currently, the finance management system in the HTL Villach is very disorganized. The project members want to improve the processes and workflow behind in-school payments and licenses and provide a centralized platform for viewing payments and licenses. Furthermore, it should inform students of incoming payments via email. This process gives students, teachers, and other school authorities alike a better overview and more clarity behind the payment and licensing processes and eases the maintenance of the in-school payments and licenses for school authorities. Many payment processes that are currently handled manually should be automated.
